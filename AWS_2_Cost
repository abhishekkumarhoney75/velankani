Does AWS Cost Money?
Please read this article to avoid facing unexpected costs!

AWS is a company and their goal is to earn money. Therefore, the services AWS provides aren't free in general.

However, there is a generous free tier - a one-year trial you may use (starting once you sign up). Check the linked page to find out which limits apply to the different services because you'll have to stay within these limits to not be charged.

If you're creating a new account when starting this course (or you created one within the last year), you'll be able to follow along all the course examples and projects for free (as long as you do so within this one-year timeframe)! After this one year or outside of the course scope, costs may occur!

When playing around with AWS or planning to use it for your next project, definitely inform yourself about any costs you may incur and how much you're going to pay.
