AWS - A Closer Look (Optional)
If you already are familiar with AWS, the following linked videos from my YouTube channel might not be relevant to you.

In case AWS is relatively (or completely) new to you, you should definitely take a look though!



Getting Started with AWS

=> https://youtu.be/ubCNZRNjhyo

This video will guide you through the basics of AWS and explain what it is, how it works and what you can do with it. A must-watch for newcomers!

Securing your AWS Account - Understanding IAM

=> https://youtu.be/9CKsX6MOPDQ

This also is a must-watch video since it explains how you may secure your AWS account AND how you can manage the permissions of the different services. You'll lean how permissions and access control works in AWS and how you best control permissions.
